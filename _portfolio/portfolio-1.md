title: "High Precision Current Measurement Circuitry"
excerpt: "In this project, we designed and simulated a high precision current measurement circuit capable of measuring currents in the milliampere (mA), microampere (µA), and nanoampere (nA) ranges. Our goal was to replicate the functionality of the µCurrent device to create a budget-friendly yet accurate alternative for sensitive current measurements. We incorporated components such as a DP3T switch for range selection, a precision 4-terminal shunt resistor to minimize burden voltage, the TPS3809L30 for low battery detection, and the MAX4239 op-amp for signal amplification with a fixed gain of 100. Simulations were carried out in Proteus and Multisim, with Multisim yielding better results despite limitations due to missing component libraries. Although we could not build the physical prototype due to a lack of available components, our simulation demonstrated the effectiveness of the design. In the future, we aim to integrate the system with Arduino and LabVIEW for automated data collection."
