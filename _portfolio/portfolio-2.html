title: "BD NSU AI SAT"
excerpt: "In this project, our team proposed a 3U CubeSat mission titled BD-NSU AI SAT for the APSCO CubeSat Competition. The primary objective was to estimate the pose, relative position and attitude of non-cooperative spacecraft using a monocular camera and AI-based computer vision techniques. My specific role in this project involved designing and simulating the satelliteâ€™s trajectory using orbital parameters such as altitude, inclination, and orbital period. I also calculated key parameters related to when the satellite would pass over specific ground stations. This required precise modeling to ensure optimal coverage for data communication and satellite visibility. These simulations were critical to validating the feasibility of our mission and ensuring that our onboard AI systems would have the opportunity to capture and analyze imagery of target spacecraft effectively during orbital passes."
