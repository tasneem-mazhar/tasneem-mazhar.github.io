# High Precision Current Measurement Circuitry

In this project, we designed and simulated a high precision current measurement circuit capable of measuring currents in the milliampere (mA), microampere (µA), and nanoampere (nA) ranges. Our goal was to replicate the functionality of the µCurrent device to create a budget-friendly yet accurate alternative for sensitive current measurements. We incorporated components such as a DP3T switch for range selection, a precision 4-terminal shunt resistor to minimize burden voltage, the TPS3809L30 for low battery detection, and the MAX4239 op-amp for signal amplification with a fixed gain of 100. Simulations were carried out in Proteus and Multisim, with Multisim yielding better results despite limitations due to missing component libraries. Although we could not build the physical prototype due to a lack of available components, our simulation demonstrated the effectiveness of the design. In the future, we aim to integrate the system with Arduino and LabVIEW for automated data collection.



# BD NSU AI SAT
In this project, our team proposed a 3U CubeSat mission titled BD-NSU AI SAT for the APSCO CubeSat Competition. The primary objective was to estimate the pose—relative position and attitude—of non-cooperative spacecraft using a monocular camera and AI-based computer vision techniques. My specific role in this project involved designing and simulating the satellite’s trajectory using orbital parameters such as altitude, inclination, and orbital period. I also calculated key parameters related to when the satellite would pass over specific ground stations. This required precise modeling to ensure optimal coverage for data communication and satellite visibility. These simulations were critical to validating the feasibility of our mission and ensuring that our onboard AI systems would have the opportunity to capture and analyze imagery of target spacecraft effectively during orbital passes.
