I’m currently working as a Lecturer at BRAC University in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. 

I completed my BSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from North South University, Bangladesh, graduating first in my department for the academic year 2023. 

I’m a researcher passionate about semiconductors, first-principles calculations, and emerging memory technologies. 

I’m actively seeking research opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue expanding my expertise in advanced electronic materials and device modeling.
