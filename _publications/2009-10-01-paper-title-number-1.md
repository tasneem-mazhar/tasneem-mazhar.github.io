In this paper, we studied the resistance drift behavior of phase change memory (PCM) nanodevices made of Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST-225). By varying the cellâ€™s aspect ratio and the parameters of the applied electrical pulses, we observed distinct changes in resistance evolution. Using finite element simulations, we identified how these factors impact thermal distribution, phase stability, and ultimately device reliability. Our findings offer design and operational guidelines to enhance PCM performance and are expected to contribute toward more robust non-volatile memory solutions.
