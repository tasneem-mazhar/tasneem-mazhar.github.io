As an Adjunct Lecturer at BRAC University, I am currently teaching core undergraduate courses in the Computer Science and Engineering department. These include **CSE250 **, **CSE251 **, and **CSE350 **.



I actively contribute to maintaining academic rigor and fostering a hands-on learning environment that bridges theory with practical implementation.
