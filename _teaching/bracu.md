As a Lecturer at BRAC University, I am currently teaching core undergraduate courses in the Computer Science and Engineering department. These include:

### CSE250: Circuits and Electronics

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of electrical engineering, including electrical quantities such as charge, voltage, current, resistance, and power. It covers core analysis techniques using Ohm’s Law, Kirchhoff’s Laws, and methods like nodal and mesh analysis. Students study the behavior of resistive, inductive, and capacitive networks under DC, transient, and AC conditions, including phasor analysis. Key circuit theorems such as Superposition, Thevenin’s, Norton’s, and Maximum Power Transfer are also covered. The course includes a mandatory 3-hour weekly lab to reinforce theoretical understanding through practical circuit analysis.

### CSE251: Electronic Devices and Circuits

This course covers the fundamentals of semiconductor devices and electronic circuit design. Topics include p-type and n-type semiconductors, I-V characteristics of non-linear devices, and applications of p-n junction diodes in rectification and voltage regulation. It explores the operation and biasing of Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), small-signal amplifier analysis, and various transistor configurations. Operational amplifiers (OPAMPs) are studied with applications in signal processing and comparison. The course also introduces Field Effect Transistors (FETs), including MOSFET types, switching behavior, and biasing techniques. A mandatory 3-hour weekly lab reinforces theoretical concepts through hands-on circuit implementation.

### CSE350: Digital Electronics and Pulse Techniques

This course introduces the fundamental components of modern digital systems, including diode and transistor logic gates, MOS gates, and logic families such as TTL, NMOS, and CMOS. Students also explore analog-digital interfaces (A/D, D/A converters), OPAMP applications, analog switching, wave shaping, and pulse techniques. The course covers timing circuits, multivibrators, Schmitt triggers, and oscillators, with a strong emphasis on practical skills through a mandatory 3-hour weekly lab.
