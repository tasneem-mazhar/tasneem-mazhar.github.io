As a Lab Instructor at North South University, I conducted hands-on lab sessions for undergraduate courses, guiding students in translating theoretical knowledge into practical understanding through structured experiments and project work. The courses I assisted in include:

### CSE231L: Digital Logic Design Lab  
This course provides an introduction to logic design and basic tools for the design of digital logic systems. A basic idea of number systems is provided, followed by a discussion on combinational logic: logic gates, Boolean algebra, minimization techniques, arithmetic circuits (adders, subtractors), basic digital circuits (decoders, encoders, multiplexers, shift registers). The course then covers sequential circuits: flip-flops, state transition tables and diagrams, state minimization, state machines, design of synchronous/asynchronous counters, RAM/ROM design. An introduction to programmable logic is also provided. Hands-on experience is offered through a project on designing a sequential logic system. 

### EEE141L: Electrical Circuits I Lab  
This course involves the formulation and solution of circuit equations using various circuit analysis techniques including Ohm’s Law, Kirchhoff’s Laws, mesh and nodal analysis, superposition, source conversion, Thevenin’s theorem, Norton’s theorem, and maximum power transfer theorem. Transient analysis of series RC and RL circuits is discussed, followed by an introduction to capacitors and inductors. 

### EEE342L: Control Systems Lab  
This course introduces the basics of systems, modeling, and control, focusing on linear and time-invariant systems. It provides analytical tools to evaluate system stability and performance (both transient and steady-state responses). It covers systems represented in the frequency domain (transfer functions) as well as the time domain (differential equations, state-space representations). Students are introduced to design tools such as PID controllers. The lab component emphasizes practical modeling and controller design.

I played an active role in supervising experiments, assisting with simulation tools and hardware setup, evaluating lab reports, and helping students strengthen their problem-solving skills in core engineering subjects.
